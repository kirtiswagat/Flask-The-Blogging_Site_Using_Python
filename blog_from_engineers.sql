(2, 'HALLS OF SILENCE,KEY & KIBBER – SPITI VALLEY IN WINTER', 'second_post', 'I had already spent two days in Kaza, two days were enough to adjust and understand the grueling winter of Spiti Valley – a beast in it’s own right. This was the third morning and I got up early to rush to the kitchen at Nyingma House for my coffee, the warmth of the kitchen beckoned like the lap of a mother, the least cold corner of the entire house. It had snowed overnight and there were still stray flakes swirling around in the cold air.\r\n\r\nThe most silent corner of earth perhaps – Key Monastery\r\nWhile I sat at the front steps of the lodging and sipped my coffee, I was aware of my trembling hands and lips . Around five mountain dogs gave me company on the steps and the man upfront was shoveling snow out of the path. I guess this must be the morning ritual of all households around here in winter months.\r\nUC came up to me from behind and asked, ‘Going to Key Monastery today?’. I nodded a yes. UC or Urgian Chhering was the amiable owner of Nyingma House in Kaza and he also runs spitiexpeditions.com. He is perhaps the most friendly and versatile localite I met while in Spiti.\r\nHe said, ‘The monastery is around 12 kilometers from here and then Kibber village is close to 8 kilometers from Key. Take the small Alto cab’. And so I did.\r\nI don’t really remember the name of the guy who was driving me up north of Kaza in the Alto 800. Something starting in H, let’s call him H. He was married and in his mid twenties , he kept boasting of a friend in Shimla who was soon going to take him out of this ‘harsh’ place – he wanted to go away to Australia for some reason.\r\nI didn’t ask why – I was looking outside the window in awe, I was being driven through a fairy land , straight out of some fairytale book. A single black serpentine tarmac led us away from Kaza. Ice has been parted recently to make way and after few moments of driving straight in the valley, our road climbed up sideways, away from the river to the right side.\r\nWe were spiraling our way up a small hilly slope , the snow on the road increasing at each upper bend. After a few twists and turns , we came up on Key village, a small settlement of few mud houses thatched with straw. H kept asking me, ‘Melbourne or Sydney…which will be better? I think Melbourne…what do you think?’. I told him that I have absolutely no idea about Australia apart from the fact that they play good cricket and have Kangaroos.\r\nHe smiled and pointed his finger towards an upper slope, ‘There it is’, he said.\r\nI craned my neck to look upwards. Yes, there it was, the holy grail for many,the majestic and spellbindingly beautiful Key Monastery – a mound of monastic settlement and compound in blocks of red and white, rising like a mystical tower amidst the white background of winter Spiti . The three storey monastic compound looked like an ancient fortress out of a fantasy novel at first sight, I swear. We had to drive a little way further still to reach the entry gates of the compound.\r\nH dropped me off just at the beginning of the ascending path towards the monastery from where I started walking on heavy snow – getting stuck and slipping over a dozen times by the time I finally made it to the steps. The path to peace and salvation is not easy after all. Like all Buddhist monasteries, this one at Key is built by layers upon layers, three levels seen and a basement level beneath them , meant for storage and provisions. Built somewhere around 1100 A.D , this famous building is among the oldest of such religious complexes in India – damaged, attacked, torn down and even burnt to ground by invading Mongolians and Tibetans in past, but always rebuilt once again with devotion  over the centuries. So the current architecture is something that’s known as the Pasada – a fort like monastery. Because of the repeated raids and attacks on the place over the harsh winters, it has shaped up like this.\r\nThe bookmarks of history is found embedded in the impressive collection of precious and ancient artifacts in Key Monastery – colorful and gorgeous murals on the walls, paintings and thangkas, the Tibetan religious banners, a wide collection of rare manuscripts and books and a whole lot of musical instruments. Apart from all this Key monastery has something that few places can boast of – it has a collection of medieval weapons  and instruments of warfare, kept as souvenirs of the violent history gone by.The young monks in the compound are busy just like all Spitians right now – battling the elements of winter.They are breaking mounds of ice in the courtyard and the still younger ones are playing around with the snow. As I watch the scene in amusement, a monk appears with a cup of tea , the butter tea. It’s a custom here, the visiting guest is welcomed with a steaming cup of tea and is guided around by a designated senior monk.This surreal structure , almost 1000 years old and standing tall at 13,700 feet altitude, is an ancient temple of mysticism. Belonging to the Gelug Sect, the Yellow Hat Buddhists, Key monastery is an eminent training center for young Lamas and is a personal favorite of the current Dalai Lama. It houses some rich interiors, decorated with Chinese style murals. The rooms known as Tangyurs contain rare murals, thangkas and paintings. The huge assembly hall for monks is at the ground floor. Together with the Dhankar and Tabo Monastery in Spiti valley, Key preserves some rare religious manuscripts and paintings , vital to the socio-cultural history of Tibetan Buddhism.The monk in his red robes and silent gestures, guides me to the roof at last, overlooking the valley – there I see the spectacular and breathtaking span of the whole valley in front of me. I take another cup of tea and sit down to watch – no sound, no talk , only the slow whistling of the cold wind and rapid flapping of the prayer flags on the terrace. This has to be the most silent and peaceful place on earth.\r\n\r\nI earnestly wished I could stay at the monastery for few more hours, may be put up there for few days at a stretch, maybe some other time. I thanked the monk and descended down the steep wooden staircase, level per level, finally to the gate. There must be around three hundred monks in resident at the monastery and may be the number increases in summer.\r\nH was waving at me from the road down below.I got back in the vehicle and soon both of us started towards Kibber, 8 kilometers further north from Key. The sky was blue no more and a haze like cloud was hanging over the slope above us.\r\n‘I hope it doesn’t snow now’, H said apprehensively.\r\nI just shrugged my shoulders and he continued, ‘May be I’ll be a cab driver in Melbourne, but I love cooking too…maybe I’ll be a chef too’\r\nI asked him when he was planning to shift to Australia and he said that his friend was making arrangements as soon as possible , he has already taken some money for the same. I raised my eyebrows on hearing this but didn’t say anything.By the time we reached Kibber, it had begun to snow slightly. One of the most isolated and lonesome settlements in the treacherous Spiti winter , perched at 14200 feet height. H told me that Kibber is wrongly claimed to be the highest village in the world, there are some settlements still higher up from here, but right now the road is probably closed. In my thoughts I thanked him for talking about something else apart from Australia. He parked his vehicle at almost the middle of the village, till the point where the road permitted us to drive. I got out to take a short walk in the lanes of Kibber.I took the dirt road that went upwards in a slope to the upper part of the hamlet, and towards the small monastery that I could see. In the entire village, I could only see 8-10 people outdoor and realized suddenly how quickly the temperature has dropped with the incoming grey cloud. The couple of yaks seemed unfazed and trotted on ahead of me. 20 kilometers north of Kaza, Kibber has only 300-400 residents, all tucked inside homes now. And what a time to arrive here- a remote wintry hinterland, entirely in the clutches of natural elements. The stone and mud houses looked like little rectangular blocks placed carefully in a sea of snow and ice.The village is situated at the summit of a limestone rock in a narrow valley – yes, limestone , we’ll come to that shortly. On the horizon are two of the highest peaks in Spiti valley – Chau Chau Kang Nilda and Shilla, towering above all. And above and beyond all else , this particular area of Spiti is known around the world for something very interesting and rare – the Ghost Cat of the mountains, the elusive Snow Leopard which regularly gets spotted in and around the mountains in Kibber, especially in the cold winter months when their prey such as  the Blue sheep and Ibex come down to lower slopes in search for food. Can I possibly see a Snow Leopard yet?May be if I walk a little away from the village, I thought. But that I couldn’t do – the snowfall came down again and quite heavily this time. I looked down at H from the balcony of the monastery I was standing and saw him waving his hand. He was asking probably to enter a house to my right , the monastery was locked and there was no shelter from the impending snowstorm anywhere else. He came rushing up the road when he saw me hesitate to enter a stranger’s house , but nobody is a stranger here if you ask for help, as I soon found out. Both of us knocked on the wooden door and an old man let us in – I thanked him by a smile and H asked he could manage a hot cup of tea. Today was a day for a lot of steaming cups of tea, I guess.Fifteen minutes later, me, H, the old man and his entire family were sitting on the warm carpet on the floor with tea and biscuits. All of us were looking outside the single small window in the room, the snow was still raging outside. There were cordial smiles exchanged between all and H talked with them in a language that I found hard to decipher. But they understood Hindi too. While talking with them among other things, I noticed a pile of rocks in a corner. I asked the old man curiously enough because I thought I knew what they were. He asked the little girl in the room to bring forth one of the small rocks – and indeed it was a fossil, an ammonite fossil rock.These kind of rare fossils are found abundantly in the soil around Kibber and Langtza in Spiti Valley. Children in the villages collect them and sell them to tourists and other outsiders , unknown to the fact that it is illegal to do so. But the story of the fossils in Spiti Valley brings to attention a much larger and interesting narrative , a story that concerns the whole of Himalayas – Ammonites are extinct sea creatures and their fossils, known widely as ammonite fossils are found mostly at rock bottom sea bed. So what exactly is it doing here…at the top of the world’s highest mountain range?This is one of the geological evidence that connects to the fascinating story of the birth of Himalayan mountain range – around fifty million years ago in the Cenozoic period, the Indian landmass moved northwards and collided with the Eurasian tectonic plate, thus closing the gap between them known as the prehistoric Tethys sea. As a result of this massive tectonic collision force , the sea bed of Tethys rose upwards, crumpled between the landmass and gave rise to the young fold mountains that we today call as the Himalayas. The mountain range is still rising up because the tectonic plates are still pushing each other at a rate of few inches per year. The archeological and geological evidence lies here, right in front of our eyes. The whole of Kibber rests on summit of a limestone as previously mentioned and we know that limestone are sedimentary rocks formed at bottom of great oceans.\r\nA wonderful story to behold, difficult to imagine and grasp – entire Himalayan range was once a sea bed and who knows what distant future has in store.I told them the fact but I don’t think they got the bigger idea of what I was talking about. The old man was still trying to sell the piece of fossil rock to me at around Rs 200. Even in Hindu mythology, Ammonite fossils are held in high regard – termed as Shaligrams, the black stone variety found abundantly in the Kali Gandaki river valley, Nepal. As the story goes, Vishnu was cursed by demon Jalandhar’s wife to become stone (shaligram), grass (kush), tree( peepal) and plant (tulsi) in subsequent births.\r\n\r\nThe little hailstorm outside had stopped for the time being, so me and H bade the family goodbye, thanked them heartily for sheltering us and the tea and then came back to the parked vehicle.\r\nOn the way back to Kaza, H said, ‘I have seen pictures, Australia has a lot of ocean too’\r\nI finally told him that his friend is probably fleecing him and he should stop paying him more money if he asks, upon which he became serious and thoughtful.On seeing him so grave and quite, I quickly regretted my words and said, ‘But that doesn’t mean you cannot go to Australia, we shouldn’t give up on our dreams. H finally smiled as we got down from the hill and drove on the main road towards Kaza, the Spiti river humming by in the valley floor.\r\n\r\nSoon I would leave the winter of Spiti behind me and return home , but I promised myself to return to this wonder at earth’s corner sometime in summer may be and see for myself what the land looks like and also to meet up with the wonderful bunch of friends that I made there.', '2020-09-25 17:04:48', 'spiti.jpg', 'Soumya D Jena'),
(3, 'SNOW BLIND IN KAZA – SPITI VALLEY IN WINTERS', 'thrid_blog', 'The month of March ushers in Spring to many parts of the country but it is still dead cold winters in high Himalayan reaches. Going to Spiti Valley in second week of March meant traveling into the harsh and punishing heart of Trans-Himalayan winter, the toughest of winters there is to be found. In this season there is only one bus plying between Reckong Peo and Kaza, leaving at six in the morning from either side. The other route from Manali and Rohtang Pass through Gramphoo and Batal remains snowbound at Kunzum pass for almost six months, and in March, it’s entirely out of the question. The route I took – Shimla, Kinnaur,Nako and Kaza remains open almost all the year round and opens up scenic vistas ranging from dramatic to mesmerizing nonetheless .So it is from Kinnaur side in Himachal that I went trotting in the HRTC bus all the way to Kaza, a distance of 228 kms, in a journey that would take one whole day. Once out of the Kinnaur valley with the Sutlej roaring at your side, the land and the horizon begins to change drastically. The gradual disappearance of green vegetation somewhere after crossing Pooh tells you that you are entering a cold, dry , desert like landscape resembling Ladakh and Tibetan plateau. Spiti valley lies isolated in North Eastern Himachal Pradesh separated from it’s cousin Lahaul by the mighty Kunzum pass and the longer route from Shimla side gives you many advantages – gradual acclimatization to prepare you for the harsher conditions in Spiti and dramatically beautiful mountain scenery for company at each bend on the road.The road goes east from the town of Reckong Peo in Kinnaur district – Pangi,Ribba,Spello,Hurling,Pooh,Nako, Sumdo, Dhankar and finally Kaza.The Spiti border begins at Sumdo near an area which is very close to the Chinese/Tibetan border. As the state run bus screeched to a halt on top of the mountain road at Nako, all of us got down to watch in awe at the strange land we are travelling in, a vast expanse of rock, boulders, loose soil and a lot of snow in March. The notorious Malling Nullah on the route was still frozen – lucky because as soon as it melts late in the winter, the adjacent road becomes prone to landslides all too easily. But it looked almost surreal through the cold bus window,falling water frozen midway and water dripping down with much effort.The valley of Spiti opened up wider around late afternoon, somewhere 70-80 kms before reaching Kaza. Small hamlets with few mud houses showed up but the land was still in grip of a long frozen winter. And there it was – Spiti river down below, greenish blue and flowing in grip of the winter terrain. My watch showed quarter to five when the modest settlements of Kaza finally showed up. Slanting rays of the sun over the icy white valley floor was giving off a stark warning – it will be dark soon and it’s going to get cold, very cold.The town of Kaza sits on the valley floor which was all but white now except a few barren rocky patches. Large looming mountains all around and the Spiti river flowing sluggishly down below in it’s bed. The river looked spread out like veins and arteries laid out in the frozen valley, it would be few months before Spiti valley turns it’s shade again to green and brown of the summers.Walking away from the small bus depot, I loitered around the center of Kaza in the main market with the bag slung over my tired back. Darkness was creeping in and the streets looked empty of people, more than half of the shops were already shuttered down. As the chill gripped me strongly and I was breathing heavily in icy vapors , a new problem was at hand – I got turned down from eight or ten places while searching for a place to stay.\r\n‘You shouldn’t have come at this time. All pipelines are frozen, there is no water in here. The toilet is not working. Bad time to visit Kaza’ – I was told around by many people.Around six in the evening , while I sat near the market place , tired and thinking over my options, someone told me to go to Nyingma House and meet UC. And what a lifesaver that was . It’s in strange times as these that you meet wonderful people- Urgian Chhering Dongthoth or UC in short, just the kind of friend and guide you would need while in Spiti Valley and much beyond. He showed me to the room and introduced me to the cooks in resident there. Just the kind of place you have in mind , Nyingma House in old Kaza, just behind the bus stop.Spiti means ‘the middle land’ and refers to the land tucked between India and Tibet. The valley is starkly similar to it’s more glamorous and commercialized cousin – Ladakh but yet to bear the brunt of overcrowding by tourists. In fact it’s one of the least populated districts in India, the town of Kaza, the district headquarters having only 3000 people and still it is the biggest town in whole of the district. Kaza stands at 12500 feet altitude and by evening I was beginning to get a feel of the trans – Himalayan winter, the streets were deserted, markets were shut and by late evening, the temperatures plummeted  to minus fifteen degrees Celsius.The kitchen in the lodging was the place of warmth and it was there that I spent most of my time, chatting with the cooks. At night, I needed two heaters near my bed and I kept them few feet away from my body. Not to mention , I was coiled up under two thick blankets. Dead cold winter nights they were, and I mean it.I can describe it in thousand words and still can’t tell you what it means for the chill to enter your bones.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I took a small walk down the lanes of Kaza. A flowing stream and a bridge over it separates the older part of Kaza, Kaza Khas from Kaza Soma, the new Kaza where all the newly built hotels and administration buildings have propped up recently. Old Kaza contains the bus stop and the bigger market area which slowly spread out in the periphery into numerous walkable narrow lanes leading to the residential houses that are probably part of the original settlements in the valley floor. The ice deposited on the muddy path has created a network of slush all around the lanes of old Kaza and while walking you have to keep a firm footing else the slush is all yours to handle.The small town acts as if in hibernation in the long winter months, keeping in mind that the season is too harsh for locals. Only half the shops open and that too for few hours in the day, the children and the mountain dogs keep the streets a busy place by all their running around and me, a stray drifter in these parts was discovering a wide network of inner lanes to walk around and see for myself the beautiful looking houses and the leafless trees in their backyard. Frozen icicles hung precariously from the terrace of houses and hotels with water dripping down in the sunlight, and after much walking I realized that probably I am going round and round in circles in Old Kaza. Time to stop now.Outer realms of the town are gradually getting flanked by the new age hostels and home stays –but thankfully Kaza is still a long way from becoming another Leh. The new Kaza on the northern side of the town gives way to the high altitude petrol pump and the famous monastery – Tangyud Gompa. The colorful structure looking all the more prominent in a backdrop of brown hills and white ice. The middle aged women who was praying near the Stupa inside the monastery compound told me, ‘Very cold…isn’t it? You must come sometime again in summer time…all this will seem very different’. I promised her that I shall indeed try and visit Spiti in summer. It’s amazing how seasons change the landscape in places as these. In cities, there are only three things to experience – hot, cold and rain. Further north of the town, the road leads away to other wonders of Spiti Valley – Key, Kibber, Hikkim,Langtza etc.By afternoon, the place was beginning to look like a strange settlement – as if a colony in some other planet, somewhere other than earth. The sunlight shining hard now on the white valley, white all around and as far as eyes could see. The white spread out land embedded with cubes of mud houses, mud because it helps trap the sun’s warmth during the day and retains it for the evening and night when you need it the most. But this is never enough to keep everybody in the house warm and safe, so in the evenings you see small ‘tandoor’ fire places lit up at all places- home and otherwise. A large oven of heat with cow dung and wood glowing in embers inside, a little sanctuary of heat and life after the sunset in the cold valley.By late afternoon when the sun had climbed down substantially, I walked over the valley floor towards the river bed, which in summers must be green meadows but right now were in grip of a thick ice cover. I tried to find foot prints so that I could follow because I was never sure about the thickness of the crust and where it would cave in suddenly, I have had too many bad experiences of treading snow laden paths. I jumped from patch to patch looking for firm ground to stand. Not only me but the whole of Kaza was struggling with the snow in this season I guess, a lot of ice heaped on houses, backyards, roads , everywhere.\r\n\r\nLeafless and brave trees standing tall on valley floor, waiting for Spring to arrive. But nature has a pace of it’s own, which I suppose humans can never appreciate in it’s totality because we see time differently and hence lose patience so very quickly. Near the river bed, on the edges, the ice was slowly but surely thawing and giving way to small streams that persistently made it’s way down to the river below – the cycle of nature and hence by default, the cycle of life on earth. People and animals waiting for the Spring to arrive, a Spring that nobody deserves more than these people after such a trying and long season of hardships.Now a little farther from the center, I look back at the town of Kaza in the slanted sunlight. A group of kids have found a large patch of plain ground to play cricket and a group of army men are walking down the road to the nearest military depot. Few old men, workers I suppose, sit by the road side and smoke cheerily and wave at me, I wave back and smile. This is it, we are the only humans in that vast expanse of frozen earth, rest of the place wears a deserted look. Strange and beautiful part of the Himalayas this one – the kind of place that you cannot un-see once you see it, it stays in your memory for all times to come.I sit on the lonesome bare rock for a long time , surrounded by my reflections of the place. A white and cold reflection so to speak. The clear blue sky of late afternoon was looking darker in contrast to the white landscape and the more I looked at it, the more I felt as if it’s changing it’s shades – purple and pink towards the dusk as the sun goes down behind the peaks. My eyes wide open, I tried to take in as much of the surreal scenes as I could, till – till I felt a burn in my eyes. A mere irritation at first but which gradually grew painful the more I rubbed them. I rushed back to my lodgings and tried to sleep it off but it was still there after two hours, though reduced in intensity a little.That night when I sat with the others for dinner, by others I mean, me and the two cooks- I was the only person put up at the place, I told them about the irritation in my eyes – and he told me not to wander about in snow for a long time without the protection of shades. Exposure to the sunlight reflected from ice and snow for a long time can result in eye burn – it’s called Snow Blindness , a result of my greed to take in as much of Spiti Valley as I wanted through my eyes.I gave myself a good night’s sleep and thus I dreamed – I sat perched on a hill cliff , somewhere above the valley that I see and there’s a light snowfall, gentle snowflakes falling as if in slow motion. An old man sits beside me , smoking a bidi and smiling , we wait there, I don’t know for what. And then suddenly he bids me to look down into the valley and asks me to keep quite , I see it…a family of Snow Leopard, two adults and two cubs walking near the edge of the cliff. They keep walking and then it all becomes hazy…they chase sheep or somebody and then the scene disappears totally.\r\nI wake up uneasily and put my head between two pillows because of the cold.\r\nTomorrow I will go to Key Monastery and Kibber village.\r\n\r\n', '2020-09-25 17:09:50', 'kaza.jpg', 'Soumya D Jena'),
(4, 'IN THE MOOD FOR A SUNRISE – MARINE DRIVE,KONARK', 'fourth_blog', 'They would not admit in face but the wilderness of nature is vital for the soul of weary men,the busy modern man who wants gratification from the world without the patience to understand it.The man who works and eats and sleeps and marries and reproduces but never asks “why?”. In our wanderings we seek nature to make us happy,to provide us solace like a child from a broken home.\r\nAnd so a quite sea and the sunrise over it allows us that unperturbed existence,it allows us to just hang in there.No questions and no explanations.\r\nAs you watch a sunrise over the ocean,nothing new happens,nothing that hasn’t happened before,but still something changes for all times to come,inside of you.We are at the east coast of India near Konark,Odisha where the ocean is crashing at it’s ends and the red sun is coming up on the horizon.At early dawn,it is the world of sleepless mad souls and soulful  creatures in search of solitude,people seeking things that they neither know of nor understand when they see it.The darkness of the night tiptoes away to reveal distant fishing boats returning from the revelries of the overnight fishing at sea.They look like black ghost ships mingled with the mist of the upcoming spring on the horizon. Earth is turning over once again to light and hope of another day.Two other fishing folk arrive on their rickety bicycle and throw around the net over the shallow waves on the beach and get lucky with crabs caught unaware .One of them shows me a big one,dangling from it’s fingers.The growing light reveals a  dead sea turtle washed up on the beach,and golden light  shining on it’s decaying cadaver. Sea birds hover around,sometimes perching over the hard shell to peck at the flesh underneath.\r\nApart from me , the little red crabs witness these surreal scenes of the  morning. They own the beach,trotting around in wet sands and hiding back in their little dungeon like holes. They keep doing that along with the rhythmic cycle of waves that wash the coast.Approaching and receding,eternal and forever,as if the pulse of mother nature itself.The sundry shade of pink and purple at dawn slowly turns to pure yellow sunshine.A million golden threads lay bare on the surface of  Bay of Bengal,shimmering and heaving with an old pride.A golden fabric is made to heave and sway as the day’s sun cast it’s first light on the sea surface. Something tells me that I am permitted at this hour to think of anything and everything , I am allowed to reflect on life,death and the universe.The nearest star to earth ,the source of all life and love on earth peeps over the horizon.Time is perhaps cyclic in character but our lifetimes are linear,that we are sure of.The group of fishing boats finally return to the shore,briging back the bounty of the night – fish ,crabs,shrimps and a little bit of moonlight too.The tired men make their way to the village near the coast and the boats rest along the coastline ,looking tired but old and strong for more adventures.I wish we had the time and patience of the sea,gently breaking stones into pebbles,pebbles into sand and keeping it close to heart forever. At it’s deepest depths ,the ocean must hold many secrets still unknown to men and time,like the heart of a woman,unfathomable and mysterious for all.And so this very morning we abandon time and the slow decay it brings – I guess the only way to conquer time is through cherishing it.By not being absent in the moment,not speculating on past and future while the sun rises over the ocean.By being transfixed like a child watching this scene for the first time.To understand the true nature of time is to begin living each moment that it brings. More birds have gathered around the dead turtle,nimbling away at the flesh under the shining and hard shell.\r\nThis beach must have been caressed and shaped by a million sunrises like this one,but today is different as I sit and watch the theatre of creation.I may sit another day as I have done before, but it will never be the same again.The waves will not shape up and crash as they do today,the crab will not walk as it does today.May be all thigs will repeat themselves,but in my heart I hope,that they don’t.It’s like a piece of music,harmony in wholesomeness.I try and keep the landscape inside me,not like a moment frozen in time but more like a living creature that I can talk to.Men must understand that if they go and watch sunrises more often,they can learn talking to them.The sound of silence as the waves crash on the coast.The rhythmic rising and falling of the ocean pervades everything else,it washes your soul down to a level of calmness and peace that no material object can gratify.It doesn’t give you anything but makes you realize that may be nothing else is required as of now.Simple joys of life and living .The silence is so hallucinating that the only other place to witness such may be – outer space itself.The echo of the great void,the eternal nothingness.And so in great pain or happiness ,both of which I believe are the one and the same thing,we go and talk with the ocean – with no words or language that mere humans have conjured ,but with silence and a steady eye – like lovers do when words fall short.I still believe mankind has not invented the perfect language for either love or sunrises at ocean.\r\nIt’s a fleeting moment,the sunrise.The harbinger of hope and another chance to make things right in the world .A reminder to ourselves that each day we are running out of sunrises. I say this because almost everybody I know is eternally waiting for a golden time in future when they will live the life of their dreams and some heaven sent angel will endow happiness on them. They wait, couched with anticipation,putting up with the insipid existence of their daily routine. Is the dead turtle moving? No,it’s just the waves trying to take it back but failing.Here at the edge of the land mass ,there floats this primordial and ancient happiness that overwhelms us, as if the very first amphibian creature that crawled out of ocean into land were to feel happy about the world that is created for  it. Blissfully  happy and helpless at the same time,not able to convey it’s joy in any language known to time or man.And I admit too that only because I can’t have words to express what I feel, I take shameless refuge in golden light,birds,dead turtles and the waves.\r\nPerhaps I will keep returning to solitary sunrises till I find the right words for them.All things said and done ,the sun is properly shining now and the birds have abandoned the dead sea turtle. A child ,  just arrived on the spectacle , keeps throwing a coconut shell into the water but the sea keeps returning it back to shore.Soon tired of it,the child gives up the effort and runs back to it’s mother in search of answers to the riddle.', '2020-09-25 17:14:04', 'konark.jpg', 'Soumya D Jena'),
(5, 'THE REBELLION OF MONKEYS,VANISHING TIGERS AND OTHER STORIES FROM SIMLIPAL', 'fifth_blog', 'Once upon a time in a jungle in Odisha,certain friends in a group were out to see the lovely flora and fauna.In the story below certain parts are true facts and many are not.We believe the reader is wise enough to differentiate between them.“Where are the animals ?”,one of us in the vehicle asked.\r\nHe has been straining his neck in all directions for a glimpse of any animal in the vicinity.An elephant,a deer,a rabbit,anything would have done.But the vast woods of Simlipal showed nothing that winter morning.\r\nHe further suggested, ”wouldn’t it be better if all animals in the jungle gathered at a single place for us to see?”.\r\nWe all in the vehicle looked at each other and after a pause nodded in agreement.\r\nThe conversation shifted to the pride of Simlipal jungles,the tigers.\r\nThe thin ,middle aged guide who came with us inside the national park had last seen a tiger at Similipal when he was a kid but he said with confidence that around hundred tigers still roam the core area,the part of the sanctuary where we were specifically not allowed to venture.Our vehicle was the first to enter the park that morning,a fine winter morning of 26th of January.We drove hours on end in the deserted route and the only wild life giving company was an occasional cock scurrying through the bushes and monkeys following us on trees.Our driver said that most of the park’s animals kept to the core area and they usually don’t cross the tourist route which has been roughly the same since the Maharaja of Mayurbhanj used to come for hunting trips.Our guide had started giving guilty smiles when we looked at him and after a while he said,”I am just here to guide you through the route so that you don’t get lost in the woods and make sure you return safely before sunset”.\r\n“And also to be a good company to you all on this trip”,he added.“When did you say you saw a tiger yourself”,I asked.“It was a misty winter morning just like this,many years ago and I had come with my uncle and little brother to see the park on a bicycle.The Goddess must have blessed us that day because out of the bush a huge adult tiger approached ,cutting through the fog and dense jungle foliage on our route.While my uncle prayed with folded hands and my brother wet his pants,I looked at the gorgeous animal in complete awe. I am not sure about it but I think I saw the tiger vanish into thin air all of a sudden” ,the guide said.\r\n“The tiger…err….just vanished???”,two of us asked.Well,we thought that when there are no wildlife to visit in the buffer zone,let old stories and legends keep us entertained.Just to amuse ourselves and keep the momentum going,we asked as to how did the tigers in Simlipal achieve their disappearing skills and since when? And more importantly can we visit these animals? The guide folded his arms in the chill of the back seat and removed the muffler from his mouth.He was to tell us of a legend ,that happened a long time ago.\r\n“This park was once the favourite hunting ground of the local King of Mayurbhanj and he used to come with his men on this very route that we take now.It was said that the jungles were home to more than five nundred tigers back then and all animals lived in terror of these fierce carnivores.The King’s pride was at stake because he had never killed a tiger before and in those days that meant he was not a man yet. He was ridiculed in the circles of his court and the king knew that.\r\n\r\nThe witty monkey came into picture on account of the King’s bad fortune.\r\nAll animals who dwell here have certain skills that make their survival in the forest possible but one such animal had the skill that mattered most,intelligence,it was the old monkey of the forest.One day the black faced ape had been following the King’s hunting party for long and when it got a chance , the noxious animal came down to steal the King’s golden crown as the party rested in the shade.he had been eyeing the King’s crown for long.While he looked at the blue stone sparkling at the center of the crown for a long time ,he heard the king’s men discuss their master’s fate with the tigers and immediately hatched a plan that would benefit the King as well as the monkey clan in the area.\r\nThe old ape made a donkey wear a dead tiger’s skin and asked him to lead the King’s hunting party straight to the place where the Tigers dwelt,a particular part of the jungle which was not discovered till then and what we today call as the core area of the National Park.It is said that the King fell around two hundred tigers in a single year and the stories of his tiger hunts reached far shores of the country.\r\nWhile rest of the animals, including the monkeys rejoiced at these sudden turn of events,the Tigers were so hapless that the grand old Tiger of the jungle prayed at the local Goddess for protection .The Goddess knew that the King’s ego could not be allowed to disturb the balance of nature so she gave a boon to all tigers ,so as to vanish out of sight when danger lurks around them.\r\n\r\nShe also gave them a safe home across the gorges of Bareipani falls ,where no human could reach for hunting.”\r\n\r\n“That explains why many have failed to sight a tiger ,in spite of them being here in large numbers”-said our guide,while we heard in rapt attention.“Yes,the locals believe that the Goddess has bestowed vanishing powers to the tigers in this area according to a very old legend”,the guide said,this time without any signs of guilt.He really believed what he saw that old winter morning.Around fifty kilometers into the sanctuary area, from Pithabata gate(20 kms from Baripada town),we had come to the huge gorge where the River Budhabalanga forms many cascading waterfalls like Bareipani and Joranda.On the way we have crossed many little tribal hamlets and later found out that around 8000-9000 people inhabit these forests in and around the buffer zone. Many belong to the Santhal tribe,who depend on the forest produce for their livelihood.The name Simlipal is derived from the abundance of Semul or red silk cotton trees that bloom in the locality. Barehipani Falls is easily one of the most highest falls in Odisha and it takes it’s name from a local made rope called the Barehi.\r\n“The tiger is already powerful and fierce and this power to disappear at will would have made it even more fearsome among rest of the animals. Not to mention ,a threat even to the local humans living in the tribal villages”,our sleepy and rather morose driver joined in the highly interesting narrative.“The Goddess is wise and the one thing that she cares about is Balance in Nature…..the equilibrium of life is to be maintained according to the cosmic plan.So the tiger could never use the powers to attack or maul some other animal,it could only use it for self-protection”,the guide replied.\r\nSo if I believed in the legend of vanishing tigers,then I could say that nobody actually knows the real number of tigers in this area and one can roam around for days even within the core area,without spotting a single tiger.Apparently the monkey clan was cursed to reside in the buffer zone by the Goddess for betraying the animal kingdom in the hands of the egoistic king.And that explains the gang of apes ,ravaging tree tops all around the route where we travelled. While a long silence followed in the vehicle,I could see the guide give a nostalgic look through the rear view mirror.\r\nHe could remember the days of Choudhury Sir ,the Padmashri Late Saroj Raj Choudhury The legendary wild lifer and Founder Director of Similipal Tiger Reserve.Our guide said that it was Choudhury Sir who became famous worldwide after he discovered the “Pugmark Technique” in counting tigers in a restricted area.\r\n“He also had a foster daughter who resided inside the den of the tiger.”,the guide added.\r\n“What do you mean? A Mowgli kind of daughter …who lived with the tigers?”,I asked ,willing to listen to more of his jungle lores.But what he said instead was pretty inspiring.The famous Choudhury Sir had a foster daughter named “Khairi” and she was a tigress who lost her parents to poaching. It was the Director who took care of her.In recent years the authorities have stepped up anti-poaching activities in and around the Tiger Reserve in Simlipal.We had the delicious home made lunch prepared by the self help groups in the village near Bareipani falls and then took a cool bath in the sparkling waters of Uski waterfalls.As we rested on the rocks by late afternoon,sleep overwhelmed us all.\r\nBy the time our guide woke us up from the deep slumber,darkness had entered the forests.Without losing a second we dashed for the exit at Jashipur gate which was still an hour away by road.The road trip inside Simlipal starts at Pithabata gate and exits at Jashipur gate or the other way round, covering a distance of hundred odd kilometers.But the day had far from ended.\r\nIn the middle of all this,the guide forgot his primary duty….that of guiding us through the route and as chance would have it ,the driver had strayed deep into the core area of the National Park.We would never have noticed,had the motorable road not ended abruptly.A huge cliff and a gurgling waterfall stood there and the guide was scratching his head ,looking furtively in all directions.Without a word,we all looked at each other again and admitted the unavoidable situation –we were lost somewhere in the jungle.Birds were returning home,twilight hovered over the canopy of tall Semul Trees.As we stood there in the fading light,a slight noise rose into a loud chatter.Like a lot of animals had gathered at one place.We heard a lot of chirping and animal noises but the whooping of monkeys dominated the animal moot over anything else. We trekked through a path,that climbed behind the falls into a higher ground and jumped at what we came across.If I am to be believed ,then let me say it simply and in a straightforward manner.Our group saw or we thought we saw the gathering of all animals in the jungle….yes, and at a single place.A small hillock from where the fall was cascading down was being the venue of a large animal gathering.It was exactly like the fantasy we were talking about in the morning.The resident animals of Simlipal seemed to have gathered together for a meeting of some kind.But why? And more importantly how?\r\nBears rolling on the ground,bats hanging from branches of trees,birds chirping in groups,deers at the back row,snakes coiled on tree trunks,rabbits trembling in the cold,and above all monkeys dominating the proceedings at a higher ground.The elephants looked disinterested in the happenings.Still there were no tigers here.\r\nAnd then we saw,on a still higher ground,stood a rock on which sat an old and obese monkey-and even we could see what he wore on his head from the great distance.A golden crown with a big blue stone at the center. So the story was true indeed.The old monkey was way too aged to take part in the discussions going on but he still sat ceremoniously on the stone pedestal wearing that golden crown.\r\nIt took some time to seep in,but we got the idea of what was going on. The Kingdom of Animals was dissatisfied at the way the National park was being run by the new Forest Ranger and his staff and had gathered to take matters into their own hand.The monkeys had called the meeting and they ran the show.The simple discussions soon took a very aggressive mode when the case of the old bear came up. Apparently he had been behaving badly since he took few gulps from a glass bottle left behind by some tourists yesterday.The senior monkey officials held up the bottle for everyone to see-with OLD MONK written on the half torn label. Apparently he had been caught running behind more cars and snatching more bottles .So all nodded on the agreement that-\r\n\r\n1.Alcohol is to be banned inside the park….it makes animals behave badly and makes them run behind tourist vehicles,a highly dangerous and self-destructive activity.NO ALCOHOL\r\n\r\nFurther there were certain grave issues regarding the vocal skills of female humans who visited the park,and this was the next point taken up specially by the old and ageing animals of the jungle.Animals tend to sleep late into the day and their sleeping patterns have been disturbed lately by the high pitch screeching and shouting of female members of the human species.Although they noticed that only in humans,the female member is far more beautiful than the male,but the noise making capacity is highly deplorable.Everyone nodded on the second point of the agreement-\r\n2.No shouting and howling in the park by outsiders.Although some extremist elements wanted women to be banned altogether….this was turned down in the end by elephants who said that woman often give bananas and other fruits to them on the way and hence should be allowed.Another matter which the monkeys took up very aggressively was filthy littering of waste materials committed by humans when inside the park.Keep your plastics and all similar stuff at home. So a third agreement was drafted-\r\n3.No throwing around wastes and littering in the park…..animals choking on plastics is horrible anywayBy sundown the meeting seemed to have been summarized and the Draft Agreement was made to be sent to the Forest Ranger.It was made clear that if these demands were not met with immediate effect….a huge rebellion would ensue where the two entry gates were to be blockaded by burly elephants ,to which the elephant community agreed unanimously.Our guide seemed content that at least our group witnessed some wildlife in the park,he was not much interested in the matters discussed in the animal gathering.I later found out that he had smuggled a Rum bottle and had been at it while the gathering was going on.We returned late in the night after witnessing such tumultuous events in the wild and nodded to each other that this indeed had been a satisfying wild life safari…perhaps the best one till date.\r\nOne of the things I remember from the closing moments of the Jungle gathering was that we finally saw a tiger. I waited to see if it can really vanish but it did not happen.What happened instead was equally interesting…..the weak and famished tiger was presented with some viagra tablets by the Monkey King so that he can mate energetically and continue the blood line.After all the country wants more tigers in the junglesAs the brown fox and a group of peacocks prepared for a dance performance to bring down curtains on the gathering,I heard sounds of “wake up! Wake up!” in my ears.A dream within a dream? Deep into the sub-conscious ,we woke once again to find ourselves by the exit gate.The guide was giving strange looks at us.Did we sleep in the vehicle again or what?\r\nI mean did we sleep again or did we wake up again?\r\nNevertheless our amiable guide still had the rum bottle with him anyway.', '2020-09-25 17:18:37', 'similipal.jpg', 'Soumya D Jena');

(6, 'WALKING IN THE MIST AT DARJEELING', 'sixth_blog', 'During the times of the British,Darjeeling was to Kolkata what Shimla was to Delhi,i.e a place higher up north of the erstwhile capitals where officials and people alike could go in the scorching summer months to cool off.The British while stationed in Kolkata ,discovered this spot in the hills of North Bengal in 1840s,mainly suitable for tea plantation and cool climate.Gangtok and Darjeeling can be studies in contrast when visited one after the other.The queen of hills is cold,foggy,bit crowded and unkempt at places but there is something so beautiful and charming in the streets and tea-gardens of Darjeeling that you fall in love with it.The route to Darjeeling is one of the most scenic in the vicinity as tall pine trees and lush tea gardens welcome you to the charming town,situated around 80 kms from Siliguri,near the border with Nepal.If you saw the left massif of Kanchenjunga from Gangtok,you can see it upfront from Darjeeling.You have to be lucky because Darjeeling seems to be engulfed in a perpetual cloud of mist all time round.NH-31A that connects Siliguri to Gangtok, bifurcates at a place called Meli midway towards the road to Darjeeling.A pretty steep climb up the pine forested hills and foggy tea gardens ushers you to the outer districts of Darjeeling area.The tea gardens are a signature of the Darjeeling district.You slowly move up into the clouds in front of you and disappear into a completely different world.\r\nWe have always imagined heaven to be a place, suspended in the clouds,floating somewhere far away from earth and upon arriving at Darjeeling ,you get that feeling because the town seems to be embraced by a cloud cover throughout.\r\nThe adjacent hills are not visible at all and at places the fog almost hits you in the face.\r\nWalking around the town on foot seems the best option to explore it.But Darjeeling is not Gangtok and hence you are liable to lose sense of directions and places.So we had to find a point of reference for ourselves,like MG Road was for Gangtok.\r\n\r\nAll major roads in Darjeeling converge at the top of the hill in shape of Chaurasta-the open avenue that stands at the very top.In a way the area around Mall Road ,leading upto Chaurasta is the heart and soul of old Victorian Darjeeling.Many antiqued building and structures stand near Chaurasta ,built during the Raj period.Observatory Hill & Mahakal Temple-after walking around Chaurasta ,we came upon a small hillock behind it which is known as the Observatory Hill.A small climb up there takes you to a complex where two shrines co-exit,one dedicated to Shiva-called the Mahakal Temple and other a Buddhist monastery.The charm of Darjeeling,with clouds hugging it’s slopes can be easily seen from atop here.\r\n\r\nWalking down from Chaurasta towards the Darjeeling Railway station,we saw the huge and rustic clock tower that Ranbir Kapoor climbed in Barfi movie.The road downwards takes us to a UNESCO World Heritage Site-the Himalayan mountain railway.The famous and charming Darjeeling Toy Train.The old steam engine that came rattling into station gave a very high pitch horn and it hissed like some old disgruntled demon.The railway line runs right upto Siliguri but after the earthquake in 2011,the services were disrupted and now we could manage a small ride only upto the suburban station of Ghoom,8 kms downhill from Darjeeling.\r\n\r\nThe track runs parallel to the roads and people make way or muffle their ears ,once the steam beast approaches.The joy ride from Darjeeling to Ghoom takes about 35 minutes and goes through the overlapping loops at Batasia,where the Gurkha War Memorial is situated,before screeching to stop at the Ghoom station.Gurkha War Memorial stands on the Batasia Loop where the Toy Train makes a complete circle.The memorial is dedicated to brave and selfless Gurkha soldiers who have laid their lives in the service of the mother land.The old era Himalayan Mountain railway is a steam gushing monster that throws around gases ferociously and whistles violently…it’s a child’s joy to watch the steam monster pull three bogies in one ride….and interestingly the bogies are named –Mark Twain,Rudyard Kipling and some more that I don’t remember clearly.After getting down at the station of Ghoom,if you have got the time….hike around 7-8 kms back to Darjeeling through many tiny hamlets and markets on the way.Stroll around the beautifully lit markets on Darjeeling’s slopes in the evening to get a taste of local stuff in the hills and you won’t be disappointed.\r\nThe avenue on Chaurasta serves as a common ground for many of Darjeeling’s civil and activities and in recent decades the activities have taken a strong political turn ,centered around the agitation for a separate statehood-the demand for Gorkhaland.These hills in the north of West Bengal are home to the majority Gurkha people and have a culture quite distinct from rest of the Bengal ,hence the Gorkhaland Janmukti Morcha(GJM) spearheads the demand for a separate state.That evening we witnessed yet another peaceful candlelight march from Mall Road to the stage near Chaurasta by the political activists and citizens of the hill town.Hundreds of people,marching with candles and lit torches with a banner at head reading-We want Gorkhaland.Many a times the agitators have blockaded the access routes to Darjeeling for weeks on end for pressing the authorities at Writer’s Building,Kolkata.As a result of which Darjeeling is separately administered by an Autonomous Body affiliated to Gurkha political outfits.\r\n\r\nThe next morning ,the wake up call was at 3:30 AM…as we were headed to the famous Tiger Hill to see a rare and spectacular sight-the sun rising high and mighty over the Kanchenjunga Ranges in Himalayas.An early morning ride through dense fog takes you up to the small hillside called Tiger Hill and some splendid pine forests cover the route.Driving through mist ridden pine woods before the sun has risen gives a very surreal experience.\r\nThe morning crowd at Tiger Hill has gathered already and women are serving tea and coffee to the impatient and half-sleepy crowd who are anticipating a glorious sunrise over the horizon.Sun rose slowly over the eastern horizon but a mist shrouded the hills and the disappointment of the crowd could be heard over the entire hill side.Though it was exhilarating nonetheless ,the snow covered peaks of Himalayas didn’t show up properly.A bed of cloud spread out from Tiger hill on all sides and the sunlight falling over them , spreading them out into a golden cushion.Upon descending from the hill side we stopped at Ghoom Monastery ,the largest one in Darjeeling area.The monastery is near Ghoom Station and Batasia Loop/War Memorial.It’s a marvelous piece of architecture sitting on a hill and it’s all about what we have come to expect of Buddhist monasteries off late.Some monks played around in the courtyard while the elder ones sat in rapt attention inside the prayer halls.Amid fluttering butter lamps inside the cold chamber,chants could be heard outside.We gave ourselves much time to explore one particular destination in Darjeeling,the compound containing the zoo and the mountaineering institute.Padmaja Naidu Zoological Park and the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute stand side by side inside the same complex.The zoo is an excellent place to see some rare mountain fauna like the Himalayan bear and the shy Red Panda.We had to wait around 30 minutes near the Panda’s enclosure to get a good shot of him and it was worthwhile.Mozilla’s icon of the Firefox browser is inspired by the Red Panda and not by any mythical animal called Firefox.\r\nAnything and everything about climbing the highest mountains in the world is chronicled at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute.This is the Mecca of mountaineers and mountain lovers and you get to learn the ABCDs of climbing here.Don’t hurry this through,if you haven’t got time,create enough time to stroll around the compound and see it for yourself the glorious stories of mountaineering in past and present.That evening we took one of the best decisions-that to spend the lazy twilight hours down in the sprawling tea gardens in the outer districts of Darjeeling. Men and women collect upper tender leaves from the bushes and keep them in the basket hung at their backs and it’s a scene straight out of books and folktales.If you want to buy some tea for families back home,do it here at the little country shops amid tea gardens and not at the bigger shops at the Mall Road.Not only are they economical but the quality is what we call-garden fresh.Another vital thing to keep in mind is while returning back to Siliguri from Darjeeling (if you take that route at all) ,take a detour to the lake side place of Mirik.And while on the road from Darjeeling to Mirik,we stopped over at the Pashupati Nagar market,near the Indo-Nepal border.Pashupati is a town in Nepal and a heavenly market for shoppers because of duty-free goods available in plenty.Kathmandu is around 11-12 hours by road from Pashupati but we shall keep Nepal and Kathmandu for another day.\r\nComing down in height from foggy and chilly Darjeeling,Mirik is serene and calm with a beautiful lake in the middle and pine forests surrounding it.We were off to Siliguri by late afternoon.', '2020-09-25 17:20:46', 'darjeeling.jpg', 'Soumya D Jena'),
(7, 'CONVERSATION AT THE RUINS – THE BUDDHIST CIRCUIT IN ODISHA', 'seventh_blog', 'Who I am is not important,but what I am matters most.\r\nI am a curious wanderer  and I am here to tell a strange story.\r\nThe story took shape while I explored in fascination at the ancient Buddhist ruins in my home state – Odisha .Curiosity takes you to strange places and gets you involved in strange tales.Long before the remarkable chapters of Vajrayana and Tantric Buddhism took roots in the delta of Mahanadi in Odisha,this ancient land had a role to play in the annals of Buddhism that was literally written in blood.A message of peace and justice propagated from an event of bloodshed and slaughter.Irony has always had a strong hand in history.\r\nToday when time recalls the righteous and just Mauryan emperor Ashoka,the Kalinga War of 261 B.C is considered  a watershed moment in his reign. In the rock edicts where Ashoka immortalized himself,it’s recounted how the emperor lamented  the widespread loss of lives and sufferings of the people of Kalinga during and after the war and how this event brought about a sea-change in the heart of Devanampriya(meaning beloved of the Gods)-a term by which Asoka is referred to in the numerous rock edicts.\r\nAfter the emperor took to the compassionate and non-violent ways of the Buddhist Sangha,the teachings of the Sakyamuni spread out from the confines of the Indo-Gangetic plains to lands beyond-Ceylon,China,Java,Japan,Indonesia and and as far as Greece and the Mediterranean.\r\nThis royal patronage to the ‘Buddha’,’Dharma’ and ‘Sangha’ may have been a precursor for Buddhist heritage to grow in Odisha.\r\nThe 13th Rock Edict at Dhauli in Odisha states that-“Though a great victory has been won over the people of Kalinga but the price at which the victory has come has filled the heart of Piyadassi(Asoka) with grief and remorse.Piyadassi now has come to believe that the true victory over other fellow beings can only be obtained through Dhamma and teachings of Buddha.There is no other victory”(not the exact words but the basic idea of the text)A few summers back while at Leh in Ladakh,I witnessed the 14th Dalai Lama initiate the proceedings of the 33rd Kalachakra gathering and little did I know then that my curiosity of the events would take me back in time to a place nearer home in Odisha.Many months later,in the winter of the same year I found myself exploring the half-excavated ruins of the Lalitgiri-Ratnagiri-Udaygiri complex at the borders of Jajpur-Cuttack district of Odisha.But what stories can half buried ruins narrate? Can a place tell it’s own story? The excavated sites in-situ at the complex hide many mysteries in it’s heart,some of which we can be sure of but many cannot be confirmed.Scholars may stand in perplexity and ambiguity but a curious layman like me needs clarity in facts .The thing I remember before the surreal experience took me was that it was a clear moonlit night and after a day’s exploring at the ruins of the Ratnagiri hill top I had returned for a lazy stroll near the ruined monastery late in the night.Mainly because I expected the place to talk to me and partly because the stone works look enchanting in the moonlight.While I stared at the dozen odd Buddha heads of varying sizes inside the main compound,I could not help but notice the eyes which seemed content with the knowledge of truth,half closed but not drooping.Those eyes had knowledge and knew peace.It was then that I met someone unexpected.He would have been perfectly in place a thousand years ago,but not tonight.At any other time and at any other place,I would have been startled but not at that moment. An old man had appeared at the beautiful green chlorite gateway of the main entrance to the monastic compound.I don’t remember if the man moved or the moon glided over his face,but as light shone on him,I recognized an old and wizened lama who stood there with a smile on his lips.He made a gesture which must have meant that I must follow him to the outer courtyard,because I did that instantly.\r\nHe sat on a pedestal of rock and asked me to sit near him.Many centuries ago this pristine hill top was residence to more than five hundred Buddhist monks who came here to study ,meditate and contemplate on the path of Dhamma as shown by Buddha himself.Equally extraordinary was finding a solitary lama wandering the ruins in the present day.I had questions and by the look in his ‘half closed’ eyes ,I somehow knew he had the answers.As the old saying goes –When the pupil is ready, the teacher appears.\r\nWe were on the verge of a good conversation.Me: Do you live around here or have you come to visit the ruins just like me?\r\nLama: I am a wanderer and these excavated ruins attracted me from afar and I came to see for myself what old promise remains here. Whatever has been discovered and extracted here,has only increased anticipation of great stories buried underneath.\r\n\r\nMe: You are a scholar then? I almost wished to meet one.\r\nLama: Knowledge is every man’s right and not only of the scholar’s. Curiosity and wonder are the beginning of  all wisdom.\r\n\r\nMe: You speak of this place holding great promise and anticipation?Can you tell me something about Tantric Buddhism,something for which I heard this place was famous for in ancient times?\r\nLama: When I speak of this place holding great interest,I do so with the knowledge that this ancient land of Odisha is one of the few places in India which had uninterrupted flow of Buddhist culture from ancient times to medieval times.And whatever we see in the Ratnagiri-Lalitgiri-Udaygiri complex holds great promise because as per Hiuen Tsang’s records this was the supposed place for the great Puspagiri University,a place for great learning and scholarship at par with Nalanda or Takshasila.\r\n\r\nI had heard of Hiuen Tsang and his travels in Indian sub-continent.He was a true-blue traveler in the ancient world ….may have been the very pioneer of serious travel and exploring.And we did not have travel guides or the internet back then to fall back on.\r\n\r\nMe: So the supposed Diamond Triangle of Buddhism in Odisha lies in these hills of Langudi?\r\nLama: The entire complex of the ruins excavated at the three sites of Lalitgiri,Ratnagiri and Udaygiri separated from each other with short distances  is known together as the Diamond Triangle in modern nomenclature of scholars. May be after the historical sites are fully explored ,someday we would name the whole compound as Puspagiri University as supposedly it was known in ancient times. The Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang even describes divine lights emanating from top of the stupas and other magical experiences. So if Hiuen Tsang is right,we shall wait in anticipation of great wealth buried underneath and what we see now may be only the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nMe: Wealth you speak of?\r\nLama: The knowledge and wisdom accumulated over centuries by our ancestors and the works they have left behind are indeed any Age’s greatest wealth. It’s not gems and gold I am talking about.And I sincerely believe that the ability to appreciate the cultural and intellectual heritage of the generations gone to dust and to drink at it’s fountainhead is what makes a civilization cultured.This is what Newton was talking about when he said about sitting on shoulder of giants and thus seeing farther than any men.That is why we must strive to protect these ruins.The moon was overhead and the place around me was taking a very interesting shape through it’s glorious history and it’s equally promising future. It speaks of the magic of archeological exploration with time as it’s carving tool.A place that was once inhabited by thousands of monks and teachers and where many great seekers came to think about the big questions of life and creation , was buried by the sands of time.A great heritage waits patiently in the wombs of mother earth for some curious explorer to come and unearth it.All historical monuments narrate great old stories but how many can boast of a promising future? A future pregnant with mysterious hopes.\r\nThe old lama and me got up to take a leisurely stroll around the ruins of Ratnagiri.According to the inscriptions on clay tablets that were found during initial excavations at Ratnagiri in 1960s,this was a great center of learning for Tantric Buddhism and especially Vajrayana school.The clay tablets also mention it’s name as ‘Shri Ratnagiri Mahavihariya Arya Bhikshu Samaghya’.It was active between 5th and 13th century AD.Amid the scattered ruins at the hilltop are various votive stupas but it’s the main monastery complex at the center which is miraculously preserved till date.The entrance gate to the main compound is made up of green chlorite stone with some intricate carvings which makes it distinct from other stones in the compound .As we stepped inside once again,stories ran in my head about monks and their activities that would have kept the place busy many centuries ago.The various sized Buddha heads were aglow with the direct moonlight falling over them.What could the various head sizes signify? May be they were designed as various steps towards attaining the greatest wisdom,of becoming the perfect Buddha head.\r\nRatnagiri has two large monasteries and right in the middle of it stands a large statue of Buddha which is flanked by the statues of Vajrapani and Padmapani,two Boddhisatvas.\r\nAs you walk the periphery of the main compound,the highly advanced and intricate drainage system of the facility stuns you.\r\nThe large monastic complex houses around twenty four cells for residence made up of bricks.At a given time,more than  five hundred monks could have lived and studied at this center.The center also housed three copies each of major scriptural works of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThe Lama never talked,as if he had come only to quench my curiosity.But talking was not necessary,and I learned to appreciate the soothing beauty of quietness and silence.As I saw the diverse stone artefacts strewn all over the place I was reminded of what Tagore had told of the Konark Temple,that “here the language of stones had surpassed the language of man”.Here too the stone works made the human need of language redundant.The stroll in the lonely night had got us very far from Ratnagiri now.Perhaps the Lama was aware of it but I was far from realizing that we had stumbled upon the foothills of the grand ruins of Udaygiri.I was astonished because the journey in the daytime had taken a much longer .So far so good.Like Ratnagiri, the excavations at Udaygiri stand on a hill top which is spread over a much larger area and even during the day the hillside looks beautiful.As if someone has sprinkled those stone artifacts over the lush green rolling hills.\r\nI could see the moon’s reflection in the deep well that stands at the foot of the hills.Stone staircases lead down to the well which was sparkling in the moon light.In the same time as the monasteries at Ratnagiri,the facilities at Udaygiri had their peak time from 7th century to 12th century AD.The inscriptions found at the site refer to the name of the place being Madhavapura Mahavihara.Udaygiri has a large monastic complex amid it’s ruins and among it’s many relics the most interesting are the unearthed images of ‘Dhyani Buddhas’.\r\nNot to miss out on details,the Lama showed me a stone carving on the entrance wall of the compound.Even in the moonlight,I could make out the figure.It was a human figure swinging on a rope with his eyes closed,in a prefect state of happiness.Nobody perhaps knows who or what the figure means,but may be it means exactly what the viewer feels by watching it,a sense of calm and bliss.A single piece of stone can speak to you across the length of ages.On the hills of Udaygiri there exists a huge Mahastupa where four cardinal Buddhas sit facing each direction.Akshobya facing East,Amitabha facing West,Amoghasiddhi facing North and Ratnasambhava facing South.\r\nI returned to the conversation at hand.', '2020-09-25 17:31:17', 'budha.jpg', 'Soumya D Jena');
